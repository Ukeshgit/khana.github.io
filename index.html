        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Nepal recently experienced a catastrophic earthquake that destroyed or severely damaged much of the infrastructure and a large percent of the buildings including schools.
            Nepal was one of the poorest countries in the world even before the earthquake.
            We are at the beginning of what will be a very disruptive transformation in education in general. Hundreds of years of education practice are about to be replaced with a new learning paradigm.  The transition is expected to be very quick (at least in developed countries). Countries that do not effectively transition will lose competitiveness and have a difficult time regaining it.  Developing countries are at risk that the knowledge/skill gap to the most competitive developed countries will increase even further making it even more difficult for them economically.
            Even before the earthquake, efforts were underway to raise the education standards in Nepal. The earthquake lends a sense of urgency to such projects, but also created an opportunity.  Before the earthquake change was desired but the pressures to do so quickly were few. Because the earthquake damaged so much, not changing is no longer an option for many communities.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The educational system in Nepal was long based on home-schooling and gurukulas.[1] This was similar to the former Indian system of education, in which the pupils would learn either in their homes or with reputed priests or Gurus. Before Nepal was declared a democratic country, the general public had no access to formal education. The first formal school, Durbar High School, established by Jung Bahadur Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. The birth of Nepalese democracy in 1951 opened its classrooms to a more diverse population.[1] Education in Nepal from the primary school to the university level has been modeled from the very inception on the Indian system, which is in turn the legacy of the old British Raj.[2]</p>
